Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and
executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and
for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the
user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application
development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side
scripts.

Though .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" does not refer to a particular
file in this context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of
asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many
input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser
games).[7]
